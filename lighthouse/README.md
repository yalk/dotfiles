In the demo a hotkey is mapped to `lighthouse | sh` with `lighthouserc` using `cmd.py`, which is included in `config/lighthouse/` and installed by `make config`.
# Installation

Available in the AUR as [lighthouse-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lighthouse-git/).

Manual build
---

Build the binary.

    make

Copy it to some location in your $PATH.

    sudo cp lighthouse /usr/bin/lighthouse

Create config files. (This is important!)

    make config
    
You may also need to make all the `cmd` scripts executable.  (If you write your own script, be sure to make that exectuable as well.)

    chmod +x ~/.config/lighthouse/cmd*

# How to use
Typically you'll want to map a hotkey to run

    lighthouse | sh

Lighthouse is a simple dialog that pipes whatever input you type into
the standard input of the executable specified by `cmd=[file]` in your
`lighthouserc`. The standard output of that executable is then used to
generate the results.  A selected result (move with arrow keys to highlight
and then hit enter to select) will then have its `action`
printed to standard out (and in the case above, into the shell).

Syntax
---
The syntax of a result is simple.
`{ title | action }`
The `title` is displayed in the results and the `action` is written to standard out
when that result is selected.  A common use case would therefore be
`lighthouse | sh` and `action` would be some shell command.  Run `make config` and then
`lighthouse | sh` to see this in action.  The `title` will be `look! [input]` and the
`action` will be `[input]`, so you've effectively created a small one time shell prompt.
To create multiple results simply chain them together: `{ title1 | action1 }{ title2 | action2 }`

There is also image support in the form `{ %Ifile.png% <- an image! | feh file.png }`.
To use `%` as a character, escape it with `\%`.
Currently only PNG images are supported.

Other ways to use lighthouse
---
Because everything is handled through standard in and out, you can use pretty much any
executable.  If you want to use a python file `~/.config/lighthouse/cmd.py`, simply point to it in `~/.config/lighthouse/lighthouserc`
by making the line `cmd=~/.config/lighthouse/cmd.py`.  (Be sure to include `#!/usr/bin/python` at the top of your script!)  If you'd like some inspiration, check out the script in `config/lighthouse/cmd.py`.

Debugging your script
---
Run `lighthouse` in your terminal and look at the output.  If the script crahes you'll see its
standard error, and if it succeeds you'll see what lighthouse is outputting.  Check out
`config/lighthouse/cmd` for an example of a basic script and `config/lighthouse/cmd.py` for a
more complex script.

Note that any files being used by lighthouse, including images in the results, the command file and optional configuration files must escape certain characters: ` |, &, ;, <, >, (, ), {, }`.

Options
---
The `-c` command line flag will allow you to set a custom location for the configurations file.
An example would be `lighthouse -c ~/lighthouserc2`.

Configuration file
---
Check out the sample `lighthouserc` in `config/lighthouse`.  Copy it to your directory by
running `make config`.

List of settings you can set in the configuration file:
- `font_name`
- `font_size`
- `horiz_padding`
- `cursor_padding`
- `height`
- `width`
- `x`
- `y`
- `max_height`
- `screen`
- `desktop`
- `backspace_exit`
- `cmd`
- `query_fg`, `query_bg`, `result_fg`, `result_bg`, `hightlight_fg`, `highlight_bg`
- `dock_mode` (i3 users must set it to 0)

TODO
---
Add alignment, colors and other formatting features to the results syntax.

BUGS
---
The cursor doesn't actually move the text backwards, making it hard to edit longer strings
